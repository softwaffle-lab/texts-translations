When important news comes out, previously reliable indicators and trading systems happen to generate false signals. This is no surprise, because a fundamental factor may bring great volatility to the market.</p><p>This is the reason why experienced traders prefer to pause when important news is about to come out. This explains low activity on the markets when charts display prices in a sideways trend. However, this makes it possible to determine the price channel. Upon the release of news, a movement occurs and once the price channel is broken, you should immediately enter into a transaction in the strike direction.</p><p>The example shows that a news release brought a lot of buyers to the market which resulted in a broken price channel. This means you should buy a <strong>CALL</strong> option: </p><img src='/assets/strategy/news-3-en.jpg'><p>Remember that a plummeting  exchange rate resulting from the news does not last forever: usually the rate gradually reverts to the level it was at before the information was released. Therefore, if you did not manage to open a relevant type of the transaction immediately after the release of the news, it is better not to risk trying to catch the trend going away. You might want to pause and resume trading in a couple of hours when the market digests the news and regains its stability.</p><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",

  "$faq@-4-q-3": "Bonus withdrawal",
  "$faq@-4-a-3": "<p>Bonus funds, including money earned with bonus funds and in free tournaments, are available for withdrawal only after the necessary trading turnover has been reached. The bonus itself cannot be withdrawn immediately after it has been issued.</p><p>Withdrawing deposit bonuses (bonuses received for depositing money to the account) requires achieving a 40 times turnover of the amount of bonus credited. In order to withdraw bonus funds credited under the tradeback program you must have reached 20 times the amount of the bonus received.</p><p>Let's say you credited <nobr>$150</nobr> as a bonus when you deposited your account. The total turnover of trades should be: 150 $×40=6000 $. Once your trading turnover reaches 40 times the amount of bonus funds, you can withdraw them.</p><p>For no deposit bonuses the trading turnover must reach an amount 40 times the amount of bonus received. The maximum withdrawal amount cannot exceed the amount of bonus received.</p><p>The turnover includes both profitable and losing trades. Those trades that were closed at the opening price are not taken into consideration. There are no restrictions on the withdrawal of profits. However, if you withdraw real funds, all unused bonus funds, including unused risk-free bonus trades, will be automatically deducted from your account, and any transactions opened using bonus funds will be canceled. </p><p>Please note that the strategy of doubling deals (Martingale) is forbidden on the trading platform, and trades made with the help of this strategy are not considered in processing the bonus. They can also be cancelled by the company's decision.</p><p>The total turnover per trade counts up to 5% of the bonus amount. For example, you received a bonus of 100 $, which means that the maximum amount to be counted as a bonus turnover for one open trade cannot exceed 5 $. If you have several open trades at the same expiration time (closing time), only the first open trade will count towards the bonus.</p>",

  "$faq@-6-q-1": "How do tournament types differ?",
  "$faq@-6-a-1": "<p>Binarium holds two both free and paid tournaments.</p><p><strong>Free tournaments</strong> are one-day tournaments held every week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Please pay attention that the no deposit bonus rules apply to the prize funds you receive for participating and winning a free tournament.</p><p><strong>Paid tournaments</strong> are tournaments that require a small tournament fee ($5–$15) to enter. Prizes are credited as real money that must also be processed to be withdrawn (х2). The company reserves the right to not pay a prize if there is no trading volume on the real account. Paid tournaments vary in duration from daily to monthly. The tournament duration is specified in the tournament's terms and conditions available on Binarium.</p>",

  "$faq@-6-a-2": "<p>The participation fee will be debited in your account currency in the equivalent according to the dollar exchange rate at the time of the transaction. Prize funds will be credited to your account in your account currency in the same manner.</p>",

  "$faq@-6-q-5": "Can I use my real account during the tournament?",
  "$faq@-6-a-5": "<p>Yes, you can trade from any available account (demo, real, tournament) at any moment. To switch between accounts, click your balance in the top right corner of the platform and select the desired account in the drop-down menu.</p>",

The cost of the additional purchase is specified in the tournament rules and is usually the same as the tournament fee. The additional purchase should not be confused with depositing funds to your tournament balance. If the tournament account balance is $999 and the starting balance is $1,000, you'll have $1,000 on your account after making an additional purchase. It makes sense to make an additional purchase when the starting balance is spent. You can make an unlimited number of additional purchases.</p>",

  "$faq@-6-a-12": "<p>Deductions reflect the percentage of participants' contributions that will be added to the tournament prize fund.

  "$faq@-7-title": "<span>Tradeback</span>",
  "$faq@-7-q-0": "What is tradeback?",
  "$faq@-7-a-0": "<p>Tradeback is partial compensation for losses experienced on the real account in the previous week. Tradeback is only credited to your account if the week was unprofitable, meaning that the amount of unprofitable trades opened from the real account for the last week is higher than profitable ones. The tradeback's amount and format (bonus or real funds) are determined by your account type. Read more about this in the <a data-router href=\"/main/cashbox/account-types\">Account types</a> section.</p>",
  "$faq@-7-q-1": "When is tradeback credited?",
  "$faq@-7-a-1": "<p>If applicable, tradeback is credited every Tuesday at 00:00 GMT+0.</p>",
  "$faq@-7-q-2": "How can I withdraw tradeback?",
  "$faq@-7-a-2": "<p>The procedure for withdrawing tradeback is similar to that of a regular bonus. It's easier to withdraw tradeback accrued to the bonus account. You can do so after achieving x20 trading volume (x40 for a bonus).</p><p>VIP account holders have a perk when withdrawing tradeback as they receive it as real funds that don't need to be processed and can be withdrawn immediately.</p>",
  "$faq@-7-q-3": "How is tradeback calculated?",
  "$faq@-7-a-3": "<p>Tradeback is accrued only for the loss of the real funds. Losses of the bonus funds aren't considered when tradeback is calculated. If both bonus and real funds were used for trade, only real funds would be considered as a loss for the tradeback calculations.</p><p>Tradeback is calculated by the platform according to the following formula: The last week's loss multiplied by the tradeback percentage corresponding to the <a data-router href=\"/main/cashbox/account-types\">account type</a>. The higher the account status, the higher the payout percentage.</p><p>Say, the loss of the Business account holder (10% deduction) during the last week was $1,000. The tradeback is: $1,000×10%=$100.</p>",
  "$faq@-7-q-4": "How can I disable tradeback?",
  "$faq@-7-a-4": "<p>You can disable tradeback in your personal account under the <a data-router href=\"/main/profile/tradeback\">Tradeback options</a> section. You can enable the service at any time. You can't receive payouts for the period in which tradeback was disabled.</p>",
  "$faq@-7-q-5": "I didn't receive tradeback. Why is that?",
  "$faq@-7-a-5": "<p>There may be several reasons for it:</p><ul><li>You didn't experience any losses for the past week</li><li>You haven't reached the minimum amount for a weekly tradeback accrue (i.e., $5). If the tradeback amount is under that amount, payouts won't be made.</li><li>Tradeback wasn't accrued for the loss of bonus funds.</li></ul><p>It's extremely rare that tradeback is credited late. We usually credit tradebacks every Tuesday between 12:00 and 00:00 GMT+0.</p>",
