This explains low activity on the markets when charts display prices in a sideways trend. However, this makes it possible to determine the price channel. Upon the release of news, a movement occurs and once the price channel is broken, you should immediately enter into a transaction in the strike direction.</p><p>The example shows that a news release brought a lot of buyers to the market which resulted in a broken price channel. This means you should buy a <strong>CALL</strong> option: </p><img src='/assets/strategy/news-3-en.jpg'><p>Remember that a plummeting exchange rate resulting from the news does not last forever: usually the rate gradually reverts to the level it was at before the information was released. Therefore, if you did not manage to open a relevant type of the transaction immediately after the release of the news, it is better not to risk trying to catch the trend going away. You might want to pause and resume trading in a couple of hours when the market digests the news and regains its stability.</p><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",

The same is true of trading platforms: the classic currency pair markets also pause for the weekends. But Bitcoin trading never stops, not even for a minute. This means that investors can trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies non-stop.</p><h2>How do you trade Bitcoin?</h2><p>The cryptocurrency market is the most volatile of those that are available on trading platforms. The Bitcoin exchange rate can vary by dozens of percentage points up or down over the course of a single day.</p><p>Before you enter the Bitcoin instrument trading market, you need to consider that its exchange rate is strongly affected by the news, and this cryptocurrency has been affected by long-term trends. You must be able to use indicators competently on a Bitcoin chart in order to be able to trade it effectively and make a stable profit.</p><p>The Awesome Oscillator indicator is suitable for trading Bitcoin. Let's add it to the chart</p><img src='https://binarium.com/assets/strategy/bitcoin-1.jpg'><p>The indicator is located below the graph and is displayed as a histogram.

Once upon a time, this precious metal was equivalent to the value of certain currencies, but now all that remain from those times are pleasant memories.

In order to predict the price movement for gold, you need to monitor news about stock markets.</p><h2>How do you trade gold?</h2><p>So, our goal is to predict how the price of gold will behave on a chart and to take the right action that will earn us a profit. News reports can help us do this. When the main assets that are traded on the market are in decline, the price for gold will increase. If the economic situation of the central countries is stable, then the value of this precious metal can decline.</p><img src='https://binarium.com/assets/strategy/gold-1.png'><p>Gold can react more sensitively to the news. For example, market data that may affect the price for a currency pair by 50 points can impact the price for gold by more than 100 points. This instrument is most suitable for traders who prefer trading on a highly volatile market.</p><img src='https://binarium.com/assets/strategy/gold-2.jpg'><p>Always pay attention to the impact of economic news.

The strategy of trading on market corrections is a basic tool, and it should be mastered by every trader.</p><h2>Why should you use this strategy?</h2><p>Financial markets are in constant flux: the prices for assets can both skyrocket and collapse. However, the market equilibrium will sooner or later lead to a correction of the value of assets, moving it back into the direct trading band.</p><h2>How can you trade on market corrections?</h2><p>Prices are fluid. If a price rises, then it can fall again. This is the basis of financial markets. Certain price movements are repeated, and a market correction is just one such movement.</p><img src='https://binarium.com/assets/strategy/corr-1.jpg'><p>It is important to take into account that when an asset is on an upward trend, it should not have any local maxima. Similarly, if it is on a downward trend, there should not be any local minima.</p><p>First we should establish the trend. For example, on the candlestick chart we can see an emerging upward trend. We discover a very long candle, after which we can expect an inflection point in the price. This when we open a trade with a short position. We advise you to wait for the moment when it becomes clear that such a turning point will take place. A couple of candles against the trend can tell us this, signaling that a correction is about to take place.</p><img src='https://binarium.com/assets/strategy/corr-2.jpg'><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>2–4 candles</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>4% of the deposit amount</strong></li></ul>",

The longer the nose gets, the more likely it is that changes will occur on the chart.

Clear and simple to use, the strategy is based on frequent signals occurring on the chart and offering a high probability of success. To use this particular strategy in trading, you need a candlestick chart. The aim of the strategy is to look for pin bar candles, or Pinocchios as called by traders.</p><h2>How the Pinocchio Strategy is Used in Trading?</h2><p>First of all, make sure you activate the candlestick chart view. You can do this by choosing the relevant option in the menu bar:</p><img src='/assets/img/strategy/pinocchio-1-en.jpg'><p>As for the example, the model by the Pinocchio strategy involves three candles.
